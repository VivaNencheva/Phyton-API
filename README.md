# Phyton-API
This project demonstrates my ability to interact with REST APIs, process large datasets, and automate data collection workflows using Python. Leveraging CoinMarketCap's API, I built a scalable solution to fetch real-time cryptocurrency market data (e.g., price, volume, supply metrics) for the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
